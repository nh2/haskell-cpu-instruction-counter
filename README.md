# cpu-instruction-counter

Measuring CPU instructions using Linux Performance Counters / `perf_event_open()`.

Especially useful for writing **performance regression tests**.

Counting CPU instructions counts is a measure of performance that is largely independent of machine/processor types and current load, thus making for more stable benchmarks than measuring wall time or system CPU time.

## Example usage

```haskell
(result, instrs) <- withInstructionsCounted $ do
  return () -- your code here

print (result, instructions)
```

## Example regression test

Put something like this into your CI to get notified about performance regressions in:

* your code
* libraries you use
* code generated by the compiler

```haskell
import           System.CPUInstructionCounter

main :: IO ()
main = do

  (_, sumInstrs) <- withInstructionsCounted $ do
    return $! sum [1..10000::Int]

  let expected = 90651 -- measured on my Core i5-4590, with lts-10.3

  if sumInstrs > (2 * expected)
    then error $ "sum [1..10000] performance regressed; took " ++ show sumInstrs ++ " instructions"
    else putStrLn $ "sum [1..10000] performance OK; took " ++ show sumInstrs ++ " instructions"
```


## Root permissions

`perf_event_open()` might be restricted on your system. If `cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` shows a number greater than `2`, you'll need `sudo` to run the above examples.

Alternatively, run `echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid`.

By default `perf_event_paranoid` is set to `2` since Linux 4.6 (and before that the default was `1`). Unless your distribution configures it differently you are fine.

On CI systems under your control and many public CI services, there should be no barriers to root access so this should not be a showstopper to using this approach for performance regression tests.
